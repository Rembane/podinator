# TODO

1. Logging, this might be a good start: https://doc.rust-lang.org/log/log/index.html
  1. Clean up the `println!`-messages. We have way too many right now.
1. Support for etags.
1. Make the podinator work with mixed feeds, like for instance: https://annien.wordpress.com/
1. Make it possible to mark episodes as listened to.
1. Web interface.
1. Create a "parse-all-feed-files-and-see-if-something-breaks"-command for testing new feeds.
1. Let us look at single podcasts and their episodes.
1. Just make the system more resistant to aborts.
1. Make sure that every episode is only downloaded once.
    1. Find some way to determine if two podcasts are equal.
    1. Maybe use a hashmap instead of a vector for `self.episodes`?
